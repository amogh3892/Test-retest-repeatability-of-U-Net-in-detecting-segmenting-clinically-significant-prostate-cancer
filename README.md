# Test-retest-repeatability-of-U-Net-in-detecting-segmenting-clinically-significant-prostate-cancer
To evaluate short-term test-retest repeatability of a deep learning architecture (U-Net) in slice- and lesion-level detection and segmentation of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa: Gleason grade group >â€‰1) using diffusion-weighted imaging fitted with monoexponential function.

This repository contains all the code with respect to the manuscript titled "Test-retest repeatability of a deep learning architecture in detecting and segmenting clinically significant prostate cancer on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps" published in European Radiology.
